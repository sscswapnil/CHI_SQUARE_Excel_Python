*** CHI_SQUR Test is use to analyse testing of hypothesis for categorical data ***

First transform numerical data into catagorical data with the help of frequency then find out CHI_SQUR Values.





Assumptions for the testing of Hypothesis

H0 – service quality is ((not)) dependent on the salaries of people waiting for the tables.
H1 – service quality is dependent on the salaries of people waiting for the tables.

If Chi_SQUr CAlculated is greater than Chi_SQUR Critical then then we generally reject the 
NULL Hypothesis (For Positive assumptions i.e there is a relation between the variable) but here we start 
with negative hypothesis thats why we are rejecting NULL Hypothesis and Accept The Alternative Hypothesis.

Calculated value < Tabulated value(Critical Value) to Accept the NULL Hypothesis
 
***** Critical Value Must Be Higher Than Calculated Value To Accept The Null Hypothesis ***** 
HERE,

X2 (Calculated)> X2(Tabulated)(Critical) 

18.65>9.48

In this case, we will reject the Null Hypothesis(H0) and Alternate(H1) will be accepted.

We can also use P-Value to predict the same i.e. if P-value <= α (significant value 0.05), Null hypothesis will be rejected

If the P-value > α, do not reject the null hypothesis.

Here P-value( 0.0009172) < α (0.05), reject H0, accept H1


(( Acceptance of Hypothesis is depent on Critical Value, Critical Value must be greater))

(( but with the help of p_value we are going to accept or not it is completely depend on starting Assuption is positive or Not))
